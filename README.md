## üîÑ Exchange Integration & API Support

Of course. This is an excellent question that gets to the heart of modern crypto trading infrastructure.

Let's break down how **dex-charting-library** (or more accurately, the concept it represents) integrates with major exchanges for automated trading and portfolio management.
